        <p>My favorite woodland biomes</p><br>
    </section>
    <section class="Left">
        <h2>Dark forest</h2><br>
        <p>Forest variant filled with dark oak trees.</p>
        <p>The trees are often packed close enough together, letting mobs spawn easily.</p>
        <p>Woodland mansions exclusively appear in this biome.</p>

        <h2>Taiga</h2><br>
        <p>A forest of spruce trees that is populated by ferns, berry bushes, foxes, and rabbits.</p>

    <section class="Right">
        <h2>Cherry Grove</h2><br>
        <p>An area where cherry trees generated.</p>
        <p>They are easy to distinguish by their pink leave blocks</p>
        <p>That have petals that fall to the ground.</p>
        <p>My top favorite biome too!</p>
        <img src="ImgCloud/Cherrygrove.png" width="400px"><br>
        <h2>Pale Garden</h2><br>
        <p>A dark, desolate area where no mobs spawn besides the creaking,
        <P>a wooden creature that attacks when you're not looking.</P>
        <p> They can't be defeated by attacking it directly.</p>
        <p>You will find pale oak and moss parts.</p>
        <p>My most disliked biome but very beautiful!</p>
